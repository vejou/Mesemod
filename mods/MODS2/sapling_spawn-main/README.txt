Sapling Spawn
=====
A mod that makes trees spread out and become dense forests over time.

I spent a lot of time trying to balance the growth rate and maximum tree density.
I want it to be noticeable over time, but not so aggressive that it chokes the landscape.

Fully compatible with the default Luanti/Minetest trees, ebiomes mod, and moretrees mod. Mostly compatible with Ethereal and Everness mods.
Note: The way a few trees were implemented in the Ethereal and Everness mods means that they are incompatible with this mod.
These tree species will simply not spawn saplings.
